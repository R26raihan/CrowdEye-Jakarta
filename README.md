📊 Crowd Monitoring in Jakarta Using YOLOv8n Model
This project focuses on real-time crowd monitoring in Jakarta 🇮🇩, utilizing the advanced YOLOv8n (You Only Look Once version 8 nano) model. This model is renowned for its efficiency and accuracy in detecting objects in various environments, making it an ideal choice for monitoring public spaces 🏙️.

Data is collected directly from the CCTV at Bali Tower 🌇, accessed in real-time. The system captures a live video feed 📹 and processes it using the YOLOv8n model to identify and count individuals 👤 as well as vehicles 🚗. By employing this cutting-edge technology, the software provides instant insights into crowd dynamics and vehicle traffic 🚦.

Key features of this monitoring system include:

Real-time Detection: Continuous monitoring allows for instant detection and response to crowd situations ⏱️.
Data Visualization: The system displays the number of people and vehicles detected, providing a clear understanding of crowd density 📈.
Scalability: The architecture is designed to easily integrate additional cameras and expand monitoring capabilities throughout Jakarta 🌍.
By leveraging the latest computer vision technology, this project aims to contribute to smart city initiatives 🏙️✨, ensuring a safer and more efficient urban environment.
